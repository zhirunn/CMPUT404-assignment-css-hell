* Explore HTML and CSS
** Description

   You will get experience with existing HTML and CSS and you will
   make some of your own as well.

** Collaboration
   - You may consult with others but the submission should be your
     own source code.
   - You may work (pair program) with 1 other person, but both of you
     need to submit your work separately.
   - Collaboration but be documents in the README.md file
   - Any external source code must be referenced and documented in
     the README.md file

** Part I

   Add 1 CSS to 3 project Gutenberg documents that have more than 3
   chapters each.

   Change the look and feel of 3 project Gutenberg HTML documents of your
   choosing, I recommend making the documents look old using serif
   fonts use yellowish or paper-like backgrounds:

   http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top

   Some of these books are archaic and subscribe to archaic and
   outdated values. If they offend you, choose something else from
   the Gutenberg catalogue.

*** Requirements

    - [ ] Theme paragraphs with CSS
    - [ ] Theme header tags with CSS
    - [ ] Theme images and images captions with CSS
    - [ ] Change the colour scheme to something aesthetically pleasing
    - [ ] Apply 1 CSS file to 3 gutenberg documents.
    - [ ] Include all 3 gutenberg documents HTML and assets, with the CSS applied.
    - [ ] document in your README what modifications you had to make
      to the project gutenberg HTML files.
    - [ ] Take 3 screenshots of firefox running all of your pages that
      demonstrates your theme.

** Part II 

   You're going to make your own HTML page and you're going to make 2
   CSS themes for it.

   Emulate the 2nd and 3rd design from this comic: 
   http://theoatmeal.com/comics/design_hell

   But instead make a 1 webpage about each assignment partner (1 page
   if you are doing this solo and 2 webpages if you are working together) 
   that advertises you to employers.

   Include at least 3 sections:

   Who you are + photo

   Your professional history

   What you can do for a potential employer/what you have to offer

   Then a sidebar of important points they should know about you.

   Make 1 ugly CSS and 1 good CSS just like the design_hell comic.

   You should make a page good enough you'd actually use it as your homepage.

*** Requirements

    - [ ] 4 sections: who you are, your history, what you have to
      offer, important points about you
    - [ ] 1 Ugly CSS theme
    - [ ] 1 good CSS theme
    - [ ] Ugly theme has to be noticeabley different.
    - [ ] 2 HTML files, each with the same content but different CSS
    - [ ] your photo (try to keep it professional)
    - [ ] Take 2 screenshots of firefox running all of your pages that
      demonstrates your theme.
    - [ ] Ensure that files are appropriately named and CASE SENSITIVE.
